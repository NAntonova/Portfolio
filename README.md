## Hello World!

It's very messy now (even here!) because I'm new here and in web development too. Yet, as a practice for myself, I'm trying to create the [website](https://nantonova.github.io/Portfolio/test/). It is supposed to be the place where everyone could learn a little bit about me, see some photos of my recent trips for the last couple of years, and, if lucky, shop the stuff I'm doing in my free time such as paper earrings, which look very cute.



## Below is just for myself (aka figure out for what it is)


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/NAntonova/Portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NAntonova/Portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
